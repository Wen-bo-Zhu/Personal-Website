        <h3> comments from different people about why video games are good for you</h3>

          <p> Video games are the only thing keeping me sane in this mad, mad world  </p>

          <p>  My amazing father passed away about 11 months ago... He was only 59. We ALWAYS played games together throughout our lives. Near the end that's about all we could do to distract us from what was happening. We felt we were accomplishing things because of games. It got our minds of the harsh reality. He was a great man. </p>

          <p>  As a Mental Health First Aider, I wanted to thank you for your continued attention to this subject. There is genuine care found in your videos and I feel there are many seeing you talk about this tough subject and considering things that they may not have thought of before or feel alone with such issues. Keep up the great work. </p>
